            <h3>Spirit Eyes Cannon</h3>

            <p>The Ghost of General Havlock appears to be considering using
                the canon left in Mowbray park - in protest at moving his bin
                collection to Tuesdays instead of Thursday. The cannon, left
                pointing at the civic centre in case of another infestation of
                the Rage virus seems to be the target of the Victorian
                Millitaryman Shade's attentions . When pressed, the wraith said
                "I'm buried at Lucknow, so getting here to put the bins out for
                Tuesday is impossible, the connecting flights just aren't
                there." Queen Victoria, Greyfriars Bobby and Sunderland City
                council were unavailable for comment.</p>

            <h3>Blandford Street found Wonky</h3>

            <p>Keen shoppers were underterred as Blandford Street at the
                heart of the city was seen to be a bit skew-wiff.From Herbet
                Brown's to Debenhams, the whole street appeared tilted off to
                the rught somehow. We contacted a spokesperson for H&T
                Pawnbrokers said "To be honest, we haven't noticed anything
                unusal outside. There has been no drop off in trade, punters
                are here putting their wedding rings on tick just a desperately
                as usual." Our roving photohrapher, Nathanial Ventricle, took
                this shocking image moments after picking up his new tripod
                form Chas Eagle's and Sons. Nathanial said "You know what's
                odd, the people on Blandford Street look wonky too- normally
                they'd be upri...oh.. wait..."</p>

        <h3>Amy's Winehouse into Rehab</h3>

        <p>Amy's Winehouse has said "no no no" to calls to enter rehab
            after complaints of rowdy behaviour about the songstressly-named
            offy. An neighbour, who wishes to remain anonymous, has seen Amy's
            Winehouse selling the following in broad daylight:   </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fine Wines & Champagnes</li>

            <li>Rough Ciders & Spirits</li>

            <li>Terry's Chocolate Orange, which no one ever seems to
                buy</li>
        </ul>


        Amy's Winehouse ain't got the time to make a comment, adding
        the retail outlet's daddy thinks she's fine.

        <p>Our cheif editor, Ahab McRadgie has had a long career in the
            media, despite his youth. Starting off taxing dafties for 20p, who
            he assured he needed the money to get home to his dying
            grandmother. He soon set to work selling the Big Issue, then
            graduated on to harder, more potent local newspapers. Ahab has been
            given a Regional Press Award for his scoop "Ryhope man catches
            train" and a restraining order after the incident with the
            inflatible crocodile, the vodka and small arms we don't talk about,
            but none one will ever forget. Even though we tried hard. So, so
            hard.</p>
